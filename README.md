# Beer?

__Team members__: Phil Berryman, Joe Lamb, Mel Ashby, Dan Geraghty

## About

'Beer?' is a web app to help groups of friends decide upon a place to drink. It was borne out of long, drawn out discussions on social media as to agreeing a venue. We hope to provide a user friendly platform for one person (or event organiser) to create an event, suggest a venue and share a link with their friends to this unique event page. Upon following this link, friends are able to suggest their own pubs/venues, give reasons why and vote on each other's suggestions.
